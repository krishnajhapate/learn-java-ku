Stack
a

Heap 
10

a=10
a(ref variable)= 10 (object)

Note: a is pointing to 10
it mean a is in stack memory and 10 is in heap memory

stack is pointing to heap


Note:
    Many ref variables can points to single object
    if object is changed it changes for all ref variables

if there is no ref variable for an object it will go to garbage collection
